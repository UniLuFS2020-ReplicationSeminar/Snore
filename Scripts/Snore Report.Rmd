## Snore Project

How do people's lifestyle and habits affect the length and quality of their sleep?
Does gender affect sleep quality?
People who consume more alcohol, caffeine and tobacco are likely to sleep less efficiently.
Conversely people who exercise lore and likely to sleep more efficiently.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
